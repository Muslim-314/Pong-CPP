# Pong-CPP-OOP
The repo contains the implementation of the PONG game using Object Oriented Programming in C++.</br>
This project has been inspired by [Programming with Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLJlTaFvHo4)</br>
Some of the improvements I have made include:</br>
1. Object-Oriented Approach</br>

2. Starting Screeen</br>
